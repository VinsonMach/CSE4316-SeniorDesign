This section contains the approximate budget for the project, where that money will come from, and any other support. This text should be replaced with a discussion and justification of major expenses, but not the actual monetary amounts (that will go in the preliminary budget section below). 

\subsection{Preliminary Budget}
Include a high level budget table for components, fabrication, software licensees, development hardware, etc. This should be in a tabular format broken up into appropriate line items. 

\subsection{Current \& Pending Support}
What are all of the funding sources for the project, and are there any potential funding sources that haven't been secured yet? List all funding sources (including the default funding amount provided by the CSE department) and their dollar amounts.
