%This section contains the approximate budget for the project, where that money will come from, and any other support. This text should be replaced with a discussion and justification of major expenses, but not the actual monetary amounts (that will go in the preliminary budget section below).
For building our own wrist module, a majority of our budget will be spent on hardware for the module. The main component will be an Arduino Nano with several modules for different tasks like audio sensing or vibrating. We will also need building materials like wires, LEDs, casings, and materials to construct the actual wearable module.


\subsection{Preliminary Budget}
%Include a high level budget table for components, fabrication, software licensees, development hardware, etc. This should be in a tabular format broken up into appropriate line items. 
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Parts                         & Approximate Costs (in US dollars) \\ \hline
Arduino Nano                  & 25                \\ \hline
Modules                       & 100               \\ \hline
Building materials            & 150               \\ \hline
Software                      & 100               \\ \hline

\subsection{Current \& Pending Support}
%What are all of the funding sources for the project, and are there any potential funding sources that haven't been secured yet? List all funding sources (including the default funding amount provided by the CSE department) and their dollar amounts.
Our team will be receiving 800 dollars from the CSE department for our project.
