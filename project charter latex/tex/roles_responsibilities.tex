%Who are the stakeholders of the project? Who will be the point of contact from the sponsor or customer side? Who are the team members, and what will be their areas of responsibility? Will your team maintain the product owner and scrum master for the whole project, or will that role change periodically? This section should occupy 1/2 - 1 full page.
Dr. Conly is the project's sponsor. He was chosen as a sponsor because of his knowledge of the challenges deaf individuals face due to his work on the ASL dictionary search project. Katie Baumann will be the main point of contact between the team and the sponsor, but since the sponsor is a professor on campus all team members have the ability to contact him if needed. The members of the group are Katie Baumann, Matthew Blount, Xavier Holliday, Vinson Mach, Lauren Skinner, and Paul Zhi. Lauren Skinner is our team leader and takes the responsibility of being our primary communicator. Matthew Blount and Xavier Holliday will take on the roles of leading the development of our hardware components for the Bluetooth wrist module. All other members will assist in the development of the hardware as well. Vinson Mach, Paul Zhi, Lauren Skinner, and Katie Baumann will lead the software development. Software development will include creating the wrist module's various planned functionalities.
