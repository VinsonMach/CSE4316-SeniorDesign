Explain, at a high level, how you will implement a solution to the problem. Include a diagram of major components to the system (not a full architectural design, but a high level overview of the major system components and how a user or external system might interface). Avoid specific implementation details (operating system, programming languages, etc.). This section should occupy at least 1 full page.
