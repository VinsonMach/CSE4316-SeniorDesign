This is the "What" of the project and it states what will be done to address the problem statement. This section should focus mostly on what your solution is going to be and what it is going to do (i.e., we are going to build an app, robot, device, etc. to perform some task which mitigates the problem). If someone were to ask you \textit{"What are you doing for your senior design project?"}, this is section is basically what you would tell them.
