The Cerberus wristband will be boxed packaged and the app component will be available on the app store.
%Include a header paragraph here. Packaging requirements are those requirements that identify how the delivered product will be packaged for delivery to the end-user; or how it will "look" when finished and delivered. For example, you might specify that the software required for operation will be pre-loaded on the hard drive, delivered on CD/DVD, or available via download. Software might be customer installable, or not, etc. Hardware components could be all in a single package, provided as a "bag of parts" to be assembled/installed by the user, painted a certain color, logos affixed, etc. Care should be taken not to duplicate requirements found in other sections of this document.
