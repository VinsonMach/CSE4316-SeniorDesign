In the section, the wristband layer is described in greater detail in terms of its subsystems.
% In this section, the layer is described in some detail in terms of its specific subsystems. Describe each of the layers and its subsystems in a separate chapter/major subsection of this document. The content of each subsystem description should be similar. Include in this section any special considerations and/or trade-offs considered for the approach you have chosen.


\subsection{Micro-controller}
This subsystem is responsible for controlling the overall functioning of the device.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
It is assumed that all modules are properly connected and working. It is also assumed that there is power in the system.

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
The micro-controller is connected to the Bluetooth, vibration, audio sensor, and LED modules. Once a Bluetooth signal is received to vibrate, the micro-controller sends a signal to the vibration module to vibrate in a specific pattern. Additionally, once the audio sensor detects a certain decibel level, the micro-controller sends a signal to the LED to be a certain color.

\subsection{Bluetooth}
The Bluetooth subsystem is responsible for connecting to the user's phone and receiving signals via the Cerberus app.

\begin{figure}[h!]

 	\includegraphics[width=0.60\textwidth]{images/wristband-bluetooth.jpg}
 \caption{Wristband Bluetooth Subsystem diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
It is assumed that the Bluetooth module is functioning properly. It is also assumed that wristband is charged and the Bluetooth module is receiving power from the power layer.

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
The Bluetooth module must be able to connect to devices capable of receiving Bluetooth signals. Upon connection, it must stay connected to the device. Once connected to the device, when it receives information from the Cerberus app such as notifications and vibration signals, it will send the information to the micro-controller.

    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Audio Sensor}
The audio sensor detects decibel levels so the LED can be changed to a specific color.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
It is assumed that the module is functional and there is power in the power layer.

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
The audio sensor is responsible for detecting the decibel level in the area the sensor is in. It is responsible for sending the audio readings to the micro-controller.
